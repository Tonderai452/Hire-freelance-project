## The Eventful Group WordPress Application

This repository will house The Eventful Group's application development progress for as long as necessary. All changes, when deemed stable, will be pushed to this repositor. This is a regular WordPress folder structure. Plugins may, at a later stage, be hosted as Git Submodules on seperate repositories.

Some command line tools / processes used, that you will need to be familair with are:

  - Grunt JS Task Manager
  - SASS
  - Git
  - wp-cli (WordPress CLI Tool)
  - wp-make (A YeoMan Generator)

A dump of the database will ALWAYS be placed at */db.sql* with each major push. Please make use of a good find and replace tool on the database when installing locally. Interconnect IT has a great tool, otherwise use wp-cli.
